Welcome to your Nacci Playground!

This directory is your personal space to:

*   **Take Notes:** Keep track of your learnings, insights, and any thoughts related to your SDK journey.
*   **Journal:** Document your progress, challenges, and successes.

Feel free to create any structure or files within this directory that help you in your creative and learning process.
